Q7594088	St Magnus the Martyr, London Bridge is a Church of England church and parish within the City of London. The church, which is located in Lower Thames Street near The Monument to the Great Fire of London, is part of the Diocese of London and under the pastoral care of the Bishop of Fulham. It is a Grade I listed building. The rector uses the title "Cardinal Rector", being the last remaining cleric in the Church of England to use the title Cardinal.St Magnus lies on the original alignment of London Bridge between the City and Southwark. The ancient parish was united with that of St Margaret, New Fish Street, in 1670 and with that of St Michael, Crooked Lane, in 1831. The three united parishes retained separate vestries and churchwardens. Parish clerks continue to be appointed for each of the three parishes.St Magnus is the guild church of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers and the Worshipful Company of Plumbers, and the ward church of the Ward of Bridge and Bridge Without. It is also twinned with the Church of the Resurrection in New York City.Its prominent location and beauty have prompted many mentions in literature.  In Oliver Twist Charles Dickens notes how, as Nancy heads for her secret meeting with Mr Brownlow and Rose Maylie on London Bridge, "the tower of old Saint Saviour's Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the giant-warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom". The church's spiritual and architectural importance is celebrated in the poem The Waste Land by T. S. Eliot, who wrote, "the walls of Magnus Martyr hold/Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold". He added in a footnote that "the interior of St. Magnus Martyr is to my mind one of the finest among Wren's interiors". One biographer of Eliot notes that at first he enjoyed St Magnus aesthetically for its "splendour"; later he appreciated its "utility" when he came there as a sinner.

Q4761308	Andy Selway is an English musician, most well known for his work with KMFDM.Selway spent his early years in Luton, England, but moved to Kirton near Felixstowe in Suffolk where he remained until his early 20s.  From a musical family, he is the eldest of three brothers, the other two being proficient bass (Danny) and brass (Ricky) players.He joined 'Big Boy Tomato' which enjoyed a fair amount of success in North and West London, and their 'New Wave of New Wave' sound saw them supporting bands like UK Subs and Stiff Little Fingers. The Tomatoes managed a couple of EPs, including 'Acton Baby' and the four track CD 'Hormones and Hangovers.'  The Tomatoes split in the early 1990s, and a splinter group emerged.  Sugar Snatch took inspiration for their songs from cartoons, namely Asterix and Animaniacs.  One album, "Mad Cows and Englishmen" was released amidst much touring of the UK and Europe, often playing the supporting slot to Toy Dolls.  Seeming going nowhere, the band split, though two of the 'Snatches went on to form 'The Yo-Yos', a punkabilly band formed by Danny McCormack after the 1997 split of The Wildhearts.  Although signed and promoted heavily, the band never really took off, and they too split after recording a debut album.All this while, Andy had been working with Raymond Watts (also known as PIG) and toured Japan with the band.  Realizing that he wasn't going to get the gigs he needed if he stayed in London, he moved to America where his working partnership with Watts led to his inclusion in the lineup of KMFDM. He occasionally performs with punk band Dwarves under the alias Dutch Ovens.In late 2007, Selway played the drums for the Seattle rock band, DragStrip Riot and Japanese Pop Star Ayumi Hamasaki in her songs Talkin' 2 Myself and Decision.In 2008, he went on tour with Genitorturers. In 2009 he toured with his (and KMFDM bandmate Jules Hodgson's) new band, The Spittin' Cobras.Andy resides in West Palm Beach with his wife, Christee Carter, and son.

Q7084419	Old Main, University of Arizona, originally known as the University of Arizona, School of Agriculture building, was the first building constructed on the University of Arizona campus in Tucson, Arizona, United States. Old Main is one of the oldest surviving educational structures in the western United States. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.Designed by Phoenix architect James Miller Creighton, construction of Old Main began on October 27, 1887. The budget of $37,969 ran out before the roof was finished. When university officials discovered federal loans were available for agricultural schools, they renamed the building from the originally planned School of Mines to the School of Agriculture. Federal funding allowed completion of the building and it opened for the first class of the university on October 1, 1891. Old Main, then the only building on the campus, contained the classrooms, library, offices, and dorms. Six faculty taught 32 students in 1891.In 1919, the Alexander Berger Memorial Fountain was constructed in front of Old Main. Berger funded the project as a memorial for 13 University of Arizona students who were killed in World War I, including his nephew.  Completed for $5500, the fountain was dedicated on January 31, 1920 by General John J. "Blackjack" Pershing.Due to neglect by the University, Old Main fell into disrepair and was condemned by the City of Tucson in 1938. Demolition was averted when the US Navy repaired the building in 1942, for use as a Naval Indoctrination Training School during World War II. The Navy then paid $20,000 in 1945 to turn it back into a functioning campus building.The first floor of Old Main was restored and renovated in 2008 at a cost of $4.6 million. It then housed the University's Office of Admissions, Center for Exploratory Students, and the Dean of Student's Office. In January 2013, renovation of the entire building began — including a modernization of the interior spaces, replacing the roof, and framing the porch. It reopened before the 2014-15 academic year. In addition to extensive improvements, the Office of the President was relocated to Old Main.

The line was opened in Willunga by the Governor of South Australia Sir Henry Galway on 20 January 1915, and initially had 16 stopping places between Adelaide and Willunga.
